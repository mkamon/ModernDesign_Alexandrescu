# ModernDesign_Alexandrescu

The following repository is my playground with purpose is to extend my understanding of genric programming in C++. Most of concepts used here are based on the "Modern C++ Desing: Generic Programming and Desing Patterns Applied" by Andrei Alexandrescu (2001) and Loki library (https://github.com/snaewe/loki-lib).

Since concepts here are 20 years old, I will try to confront them with current solutions provided by modern standard libraries (https://en.cppreference.com)
